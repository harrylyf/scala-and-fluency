#  How much time did you spend on this assignment?

For the assignment, I spent about 6 hours in total. But I spent more than 2 hours on setting up the IDE.

# Discussion questions / topics
Below, add one or two things that you might want to discuss when we meet again.

1. I am not sure what to do with scala return function. The function seems to be like this:
def functionName ([parameters]) : [return type] = {
   function body
   return [expr]
}
However, I do not know how to return two variables. (I was trying to return both the BufferedImage and its height, width)

2. I do not know why my program does not work. I assume the problem is when working with each functions, it did not overwrite
the original Bufferimage but instead, create a new one. And the output file was still the original one. However, I tried to
solve that problem but failed.
