The goal of our redesigned Picture library was to make it easier to compose
operations without having to load and save an image each time. We accomplished
that goal, now it's time for critique. In this round of critique we're focusing
on the following question:

Is there anything that is still annoying or difficult about the operations we
have in the library (i.e., flipping, rotating, and grayscaling)?

I was trying to define a helper function to skip the duplicate part. However, it did not work out because I couldn't
make a input into the argument such as (width - column - 1, row). Also I found annoy the output showed up as "Unit" and
I do not what is going on.
